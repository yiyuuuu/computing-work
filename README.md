# computing-work
Once upon a time, there was an ordinary human who studied in a local school in Singapore. He was depressed as his teachers were constantly giving him extra pressure and homework for no reasons at all.
However, he had his close friends which really cared about him and thus helped him with his homework and spent alot of time with him so that he would not be that sad. 
In conclusion, teachers suck and friends are the ones who would help you through the tough times and would always lend a helping hand ahahahahah.
